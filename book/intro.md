This open textbook introduces the concepts and practice of network analysis in legal contexts. It combines short explanations with executable Jupyter notebooks so readers can run, tweak, and reproduce every figure and result.

Published with Maastricht University Press and developed by the Law and Tech Lab (Maastricht University), the book is designed to support the Network Analysis course. Chapters cover foundational ideas (nodes/edges, centrality, communities), data collection and preparation, and applied topics. Appendices provide practical guidance on plotting, vector scaling, normalization, and software setup.
